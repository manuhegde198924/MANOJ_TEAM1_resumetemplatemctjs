    JavaScript (1st Part):
        Event Listener: Listens for the DOMContentLoaded event.
        Container Initialization: Initializes container elements (container1, container2, container3) and the select element (optionsSelect).
        Default Visibility: Sets the default visibility for container1 and container2 (visible) and container3 (hidden).
        Event Listener for Select Change: Listens for changes in the optionsSelect element and toggles the visibility of containers based on the selected option.

    JavaScript (2nd Part):
        Event Listener for Header Color Picker: Listens for changes in the color selected from the headerColorPicker and updates the background color of the specified header elements.
        Event Listener for Text Color Picker: Listens for changes in the color selected from the textColorPicker and updates the text color of container2 and container3.
        Event Listener for Form Input: Listens for input changes in the form (myForm) and dynamically updates various elements based on the user's input, such as headers, contact details, skills, and summary.
        Counters Object: Keeps track of the number of text areas created for employment, project, and education.
        addTextArea Function: Dynamically creates and appends text areas based on the specified baseId and containerId.
        updateDetails Function: Updates details in the specified container based on the targetContainerId and baseId.

    JavaScript (3rd Part):
        Toggle Background Function: Defines a function that toggles the background color based on the state of the theme toggle.
        Theme Toggle Event Listener: Listens for changes in the theme toggle and updates the background color accordingly.
        PDF Generation Functions: Defines functions (generatePDF1 and generatePDF2) for generating PDFs using the html2pdf library. These functions alert the user and then generate PDFs for the specified elements (resume1 or resume2) on button click.

The code combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic resume builder with options for different resume styles and customization. It uses event listeners to respond to user input, updates the UI accordingly, and provides functionality for generating PDF resumes.
