1. Download PDF Buttons

    The HTML code starts with the definition of download PDF buttons using <button> elements. These buttons trigger JavaScript functions (generatePDF1() and generatePDF2()) to generate PDFs based on the entered information.

2. Theme Switch

    There is a theme switch container with a checkbox (#theme-toggle) to switch between light and dark modes. The appearance is controlled by CSS and can be toggled using JavaScript.

3. Form Container (#container1)

    The form is organized in a container with the ID container1.
    It includes a dropdown (<select>) for choosing the template type (Two Column or Minimalist).
    Color pickers for selecting the header and text colors.
    Personal details form inputs for name, email, phone, address, LinkedIn, and GitHub profiles.
    Professional details form inputs for job title, summary, technical skills, and buttons to dynamically add employment, project, and educational details.

4. JavaScript Functions

    The form includes JavaScript functions (addTextArea) that dynamically add text areas for employment, project, and educational details.

5. Two Column Resume (#container2)

    The Two Column resume is initially hidden (style="display:none") but can be generated dynamically.
    It includes placeholders for the user's name, contact information, skills, employment details, project details, and educational details.

6. Minimalist Resume (#container3)

    The Minimalist resume is initially hidden (style="display:none") but can be generated dynamically.
    It includes placeholders for the user's name, contact information, summary, skills, professional experience, projects, and educational details.
